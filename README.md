## Introduction
My project is about representing the candidates that ran in the 2016 general election in Ireland and their respective political parties and constituencies. 
This will allow users to generate interesting queries on the data like the number of female and male candidates, the oldest and youngest candidates and other queries such as these.
The Gender of each candidate is specified as well as their age where it was available. This will enable users to generate statistics based on these traits.
There is also information about each political party like its current leader and when it was founded, the oldest and newest party can be found using this data.
Each constituency is listed in the database with the number of seats in each constituency. This will enable users to find the constituency with the most and least number of seats.
The goal of this project is to create an efficient way for users to get various statistics about candidates, constituencies and political parties using a graph database.

## Database
I decided that I would represent the following in my database:
+ Constituencies
+ Political parties
+ Candidates

#### Constituencies
I represented each Constituency as a node in the database. The constituencies contained the properties:
+ Name
+ Seats

#### Political parties
I represented each Political party as a node in the database. The Political parties contained the properties:
+ Name
+ Leader
+ Founded

#### Candidates
I represented every Candidate that ran in the election as a node in the database. Each candidate contained the properties:
+ Name
+ Gender
+ Age (where available)

#### Relationships
I created a relationship between each candidate and their respective political parties. 
I created a node called 'Independent' so that all Independent candidates (those not in a party) could be easily represented.
This relationship allows statistics to be generated on the number of candidates in each party and the youngest/oldest candidate in each party.

## Queries
Summarise your three queries here.
Then explain them one by one in the following sections.

#### Query one title
This query retrieves the Bacon number of an actor...
```cypher
MATCH
	(Bacon)
RETURN
	Bacon;
```

#### Query two title
This query retrieves the Bacon number of an actor...
```cypher
MATCH
	(Bacon)
RETURN
	Bacon;
```

#### Query three title
This query retrieves the Bacon number of an actor...
```cypher
MATCH
	(Bacon)
RETURN
	Bacon;
```
